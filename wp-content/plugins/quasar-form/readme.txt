### Drag & drop form builder
Quasar Form is a drag-and-drop form builder to create and embed forms. Our form builder is fast, easy-to-use and offers extensive customization, allowing you to build simple contact forms or complicated application forms. The main feature of our constructor is the creation of columns with support for the second nesting level.

### Responsive form
All your forms are responsive by default. You will not need to do any additional actions to display forms well on phones.

### 100% design customization
You can completely customize the design of each form. Each field has design settings. Also you can set your own CSS classes for each field and form as a whole.

### Сalculator creation
The Quasar Form plugin supports the creation of calculators of various levels of complexity. You can create simple calculators or calculator forms so that visitors send their calculations to you by email.

### Pop-up form
With the Quasar Form plugin, you can easily create popup forms. Any form created through this plugin can pop-up, for this you just need to specify ‘popup’ in the shortcode of the form and add the value ‘text’ (this is the text inside the button).
